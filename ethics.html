        <h1 class="text">Responsible use of GenAI in the academics</h1>
        <h2 class="text1">1. Use GenAI for Brainstorming and Topic Development: </h2>
        <div class="sides">
        <div class="left">
            <p class="des1"> GenAI can assist in finding a unique and well-defined research topic process by identifying emerging research areas, suggesting connections between concepts, and refining broad topics into focused research questions. </p>
            <h4 class="eth1">Ethical Use: </h4>
            <p class="des1"><strong>Topic Suggestions:</strong> AI can generate potential research topics based on academic trends and prior studies.
                            <br> <strong>Concept Mapping:</strong> AI-powered mind-mapping tools like Coggle, SemanticScholar, and MindMeister can help to visualize topic connections.
                            <br> <strong>Guiding Questions:</strong> AI tools can offer guiding questions that refine broad research topics into clearer research questions. </p>
        
        <h2 class="text1">2. Use GenAI for Literature Review and Research Organization: </h2>
            <p class="des1"> AI tools can assist in mapping and identifying the connections of theoretical foundations, key debates, and gaps in existing literature, but ensuring the literature review is well-structured, original, and academically rigorous requires more than automation. </p>
            <h4 class="eth1">Ethical Use: </h4>
            <p class="des1"><strong>Identifying Relevant Studies: </strong> AI tools can quickly scan databases to highlight pertinent research papers, saving time in the initial stages of a literature review.​
                            <br> <strong>Organizing References: </strong> AI-powered citation managers can help in categorizing and formatting references according to various academic styles.​
                            <br> <strong>Recognizing Research Gaps:</strong>AI can highlight underexplored areas, but only critical analysis ensures meaningful contribution.</p>
        
        <h2 class="text1">3. Use GenAI for Structuring and Outlining Academic Papers: </h2>
            <p class="des1"> AI-powered structuring tools can simplify the outlining process. While AI can suggest logical sequences and transitions, academic integrity requires adjusting these structures to ensure alignment with student’s research and argumentation. </p>
            <h4 class="eth1">Ethical Use: </h4>
            <p class="des1"><strong>Outline Generation: </strong> AI tools can quickly scan databases to highlight pertinent research papers, saving time in the initial stages of a literature review.​
                            <br> <strong>Section Headings and Transitions: </strong> AI-powered citation managers can help in categorizing and formatting references according to various academic styles.​
                            <br> <strong>Customizing AI Suggestions: </strong>AI-generated structures should be adjusted to align with individual research goals.</p>
        
        <h2 class="text1">14 Use GenAI for Improving Writing Clarity and Style: </h2>
            <p class="des1">AI-powered editing tools can help refine sentence structure, enhance readability, and shows areas for improvement, but ethical use means ensuring that your voice and argument remain intact.</p>
            <p class="des1"><strong>Grammar and Style Improvements:</strong> AI tools such as Grammarly and LanguageTool can enhance sentence structure and readability.
                            <br> <strong>Alternative Phrasing Suggestions:</strong> AI can recommend clearer, more concise wording while preserving meaning.
                            <br> <strong>Passive Voice and Awkward Phrasing Detection: </strong>AI can highlight unclear or overly complex sentences for revision.</p>

        <div class="right">
            <h4 class="eth2">Unethical Use: </h4>
            <p class="des2"><strong>Unverified AI Suggestions:</strong> AI can generate potential research topics based on academic trends and prior studies.
                            <br> <strong>Overreliance on AI:</strong> AI-powered mind-mapping tools like Coggle, SemanticScholar, and MindMeister can help to visualize topic connections.
                            <br> <strong>Skipping Critical Evaluation: </strong> AI tools can offer guiding questions that refine broad research topics into clearer research questions. 
                            <br> <strong>AI-Generated Thesis Statements:</strong> AI-powered mind-mapping tools like Coggle, SemanticScholar, and MindMeister can help to visualize topic connections.
                            <br> <strong>Letting AI Perform Critical Analysis or Interpretation: </strong> AI tools can offer guiding questions that refine broad research topics into clearer research questions. </p>

            <h4 class="eth2">Unethical Use: </h4>
            <p class="des2"><strong>Blind Trust in AI Outputs:</strong> AI can sometimes generate citations that are incorrect or fabricated. Always verify the authenticity of suggested sources.​
                            <br> <strong>Replacing Critical Reading: </strong> Relying solely on AI-generated summaries without engaging with the full texts can lead to superficial understanding.​</p>
                           
            <h4 class="eth2">Unethical Use: </h4>
            <p class="des2"><strong>Rigid Adherence to AI Suggestions:</strong>  An AI-generated outline should not constrain the natural progression of ideas. Flexibility is key to ensuring the paper accurately reflects the research.​
                            <br> <strong>Neglecting Coherence:</strong>  Ensure that the structure proposed by AI maintains a logical flow and effectively supports the thesis statement.
                            <br> <strong>Overlooking Depth: </strong> AI can provide frameworks, but deeper analysis and argument development come from critical engagement with the material.​</p>
            
            <h4 class="eth2">Unethical Use: </h4>
            <p class="des3"><strong>Over-reliance on AI for Rewriting:</strong>: AI should enhance clarity, not replace your personal writing style.
                            <br> <strong>Accepting AI Edits Without Review:</strong> Automated suggestions may misinterpret context or introduce inaccuracies.
                            <br> <strong>Allowing AI to Rewrite Complex Theoretical Arguments: </strong> AI editing tools should assist with grammar, readability, and style, not rewrite complex arguments or interpretations. Extensive reliance on AI for rewriting can distort your intended meaning and compromise originality and depth. </p>
